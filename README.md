# Formative Assessment Statistics

### *SCOPE*
The scope of this assessment is to perform basic EDA on the given dataset 'house_price.csv' and detect outliers using statistical methods such as:

1. Mean and standard deviation Method.
2. Percentile method.
3. IQR - Interquartile Range method.
4. Z-score method.

Then, remove the outliers using methods like trimming, capping, or imputation with the mean or median. Create a box plot to determine which method works best for removing outliers in this data. Draw a histogram to check the normality of the 'price per sqft' column and perform transformations if needed. Check the skewness and kurtosis before and after the transformation. Check the correlation between all the numerical columns and plot a heatmap. Draw scatter plots between the variables to check the correlation between them.
